## Instructions
This assignment will cover the material on binary variables and interaction terms, focusing mostly on logistic regression.

**Please begin by adding your name to the top of the document on line 3.** Instructions for how to submit the assignment are provided at the bottom on the document. The procedure is the same as the previous assignments.

Next, run the chunk above to load the relevant packages. You may need to install some of the packages before proceeding, so pay attention to any error messages in the Console.

## Data

You will be using the Diffusion of Microfinance dataset discussed in class. It contains individual survey responses for over sixteen thousand respondents in seventy-five villages in Karnataka, India. You can read more about the data in this Science article: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1236498. The data you are using here are from the replication repository on the Harvard Dataverse.

Run the chunk below to load and clean the individual-level survey data. Note that a small number of respondents with missing data have been removed.

```{r loading, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# Do not modify this code
data <- read_dta("data/individual_characteristics.dta") %>%
    select(village, resp_gend, age, religion, caste, subcaste, educ, 
           villagenative, shgparticipate, workflag, savings) %>%
     filter(across(everything(), ~ . > 0)) %>% # dropping missing (negative values)
     mutate(gender = as.factor(ifelse(resp_gend == 1, "Male", "Female")),
           religion = recode_factor(as.factor(religion), `1` = "Hindu", `2` = "Muslim", `3` = "Christian"),
           caste = recode_factor(as.factor(caste), `1` = "SC", `2` = "ST", `3` = "OBC",
                                 `4` = "GC"), # See paragraph below for discussion.
           shg = ifelse(shgparticipate == 1, 1, 0), # 1 = participant
           native = ifelse(villagenative == 1, "native", "nonnative"), # Native = Born in current village
           educ = replace(educ, educ == 16, 0), # Zero education was coded as 16, switched to 0
           educ_none = ifelse(educ == 0, 1, 0), # No formal education
           worked = ifelse(workflag ==1, 1, 0), # 1 = worked last week
           savings = ifelse(savings==1, 1, 0), # 1 = has savings account
           village = as.factor(village)) %>% # village
    select(shg, gender, village, age, educ, educ_none, religion, caste, subcaste, native, worked, savings)

# Specifying reference groups for categorical variables
data <- data %>% mutate(caste = relevel(caste, ref = "GC"),
                        religion = relevel(religion, ref = "Hindu"),
                        gender = relevel(gender, ref = "Male"))
```

*A note on caste*
If you are unfamiliar with the concept of caste, you may want to take a quick look at this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India. Caste is somewhat analogous to ethnicity, but with a distinct hierarchical, relational component.

You will be using with four categories of caste rather than the dummy version used in lecture. The Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (SC and ST) are the more marginalized and disadvantaged groups in this context. The OBC (Other Backwards Classes) and General Classes (GC) are more advantaged. The OBC group is quite heterogeneous, but the GC considered the more dominant group. These categories of caste are used by the Indian government and aggregate members of disparate subcastes (or jatis). The `subcaste` column includes a more specific caste designation. There are 424 unique subcastes in the dataset, although a substantial number are likely duplicates (e.g. same names spelled differently). See section 2.2 of this working paper (https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j367u/) for discussion of caste in Karnataka in the context of this dataset.

## Questions

Q1. Use these data to estimate an LPM predicting whether a respondent worked in the previous week (`worked`) as a function of gender, caste, age, and education. Please also include a term for `village` to account for unmeasured village-level variation. This will be suppressed from the regression tables. Do not include any additional variables or transformations. Once you have the results, answer the question below.

```{r q1, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
lpm <- # Complete the model

# Run this line to make a table. The output is rendered using the huxtable package. You may get an error if you do not have it installed.
modelsummary(list("LPM"=lpm), stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001), gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE",
             coef_omit = "village*", output = "huxtable")
```

Question: Write a paragraph describing the results of the model. Discuss each of the coefficients AND interpret the intercept.
Answer:

Q2. Interpret the R-squared statistic and explain why it is unreliable for binary outcomes.
Answer:

Q3. Use the `predict` function to obtain the predicted probabilities for each observation. Calculate the proportion of predicted values outside of the [0,1] range and print your answer. Use the `hist()` function to make a histogram to show the distribution of the predicted values.

```{r q3, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Your code here
```

Q4. Estimate the same model using a logistic regression then write a response to the question below.

```{r q4, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
logistic <- # Your code here

modelsummary(list("LPM" = lpm, "Logistic" = logistic), stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001),
             gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE", coef_omit = "village*", output = "huxtable")
```
A: Take the coefficients for education and caste and intepret each. Explain the difference in interpretations between the LPM and the logistic regression model.
Answer:

B: The divide-by-4-rule helps to make the coefficients more comparable. Divide the logistic regression coefficients for gender by 4 and discuss the interpretation. Compare the results to those from the LPM.
Answer:

Q5: The chunk below gets the predicted probabilities for each observation from the two models and plots them as a scatterplot. You do not need to modify the code. Each point is shaded according to whether the true value of `worked` is 1 or 0. Run the code and answer the questions below.

```{r q5, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# Do not modify this code
p.lpm <- predict(lpm)
p.logistic <- predict(logistic, type = "response")
d <- data %>% mutate(p.lpm = p.lpm, p.logistic = p.logistic)
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = p.lpm, y = p.logistic, color = as.factor(worked))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
    ylim(0, 1) + xlim(0,1.25) + theme_minimal() +
    labs(x="Predicted value (LPM)", y = "Predicted value (logistic)",
         color = "Worked last week (1=Yes)")
```
Question: Discuss the result shown in the graph about. What does this tell us about differences between the predictions of the two models? The dashed and solid lines should be helpful as you interpret the result.
Answer:

Q6: What are the main advantages of logistic regression compared to the linear probability model? Are there any reason why we might want to use an LPM?
Answer: 

Q7: Modify the arguments of `modelsummary` to include an argument to exponentiate the coefficients in the results. Run the chunk and answer the question below.

```{r q4, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
modelsummary(list("Logistic" = logistic), stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001), gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE",
             coef_omit = "village*", output = "huxtable", ) # Add argument
```
Question: Write a paragraph describing the interpretation of the exponentiated coefficients for gender and age.
Answer: 

Q8. Estimate three more models predicting `worked` with alternative model specifications. You may use any combination of the following variables: `shg`, `gender`, `age`, `educ`, `educ_none`, `religion`, `caste`, `native`, `savings`. You are welcome to include transformations of these variables (e.g. logarithms, polynomials) but do not modify the dependent variable.

```{r q8, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
m1 <- # First specification here
m2 <- # Second specification here
m3 <- # Third specification here
    
modelsummary(list(m1, m2, m3), stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001), gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE",
             coef_omit = "village*", output = "huxtable")
```

Q9. Use the log-likelihood scores in the table above to compare the three models. Discuss the differences between the three models and whether a particular specification is preferable. You do not need to interpret every single coefficient, but you may want to make reference to any notable observations in your answer.
Answer:

Q10. Several alternatives to R-squared have been proposed for logistic regression. One of these, McFadden's R-squared, was discussed in lecture. This website (https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/) includes a table containing several commonly encountered variations. 

Use the code chunk below to create a function to calculate the Efron's R-squared. Use this function to calculate the Efron's R-squared for each of the three models from Q8 then answer the question below.

For your convenience, the equation for Efron's R-squared is rendered here using LaTeX, where $\hat{p}$ is a vector of predicted probabilities from the model:

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{p_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$$

```{r q10, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
efron <- function() {} # Complete the function
# Use efron to calculate scores for models m1, m2, and m3. Print all three results.
```
Question: Are the results consistent with those discussed in the previous answer (Q9)? Discuss any discrepancies.
Answer: 

***Note: The following questions are based on material from the lecture on 3/28 so some of the material may be unfamiliar if you are attempting to complete this before the lecture.***

Q11. Estimate a logistic regression model to predict `savings`. Include predictors for gender, caste, age, education, as well as an interaction between age and education. *Do not include any village fixed-effects.* Answer the question below. 

```{r q11, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
savings.logit <- # Your code here
modelsummary(list("Savings"=savings.logit),
             stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001), gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE", output = "huxtable")
```
Question A: Interpret the log-odds coefficients for education, age, and the interaction between them. What does this model tell us about these variables?
Answer: 

Q12. When analyzing generalized linear models, it is often helpful to make predictions for average respondents. This can be more meaningful than interpreting coefficients. Construct a new dataset containing two rows, one for the average male and one for the average female. Use the mean value of each variable. The mean is undefined for caste, so set both values to the most numerous group, "OBC". Print this new dataset then use these average respondents to predict the probability that the average male and female respondent has a savings account. Answer the question below.
```{r q12, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Your answer here
```
Question: According to these predictions, is there any difference in the probability of possessing a savings account by gender?
Answer: 

Q13. Extend the previous model by adding a coefficient for age-squared and education-squared. Make sure to use the `I()` notation discussed in class. Answer the questions below.

```{r q13, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
savings.logit2 <- # Your code here
modelsummary(list("Savings I" = savings.logit, "Savings II" = savings.logit2),
             stars = c("*" = 0.05, "**" = 0.01, "***" = 0.001), gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE", output = "huxtable")
```
Question A: Has the model fit improved by adding these squared terms? Has anything else changed?
Answer:

Question B: Does this change impact the interpretation of the interaction between age and education?
Answer: 

Q14. Let's the average marginal effect of each predictor to better understand the results of the model. Run the code chunk and answer the question below.

```{r q14, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Do not modify
ME <- marginaleffects(savings.logit2)
AME <- ME %>% summary()
print(AME)
```
Question: Write a paragraph to interpret the marginal effects for age, caste, and education.
Answer:

Q15. We can use conditional marginal effects to better understand the interactions. The code below creates two pairs of plots, one for each of the previous models. Run the code and answer the question below.

```{r q15, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Do not modify this code
a <- plot_cme(savings.logit, effect = "educ", condition = "age")
b <- plot_cme(savings.logit, effect = "age", condition = "educ")
c <- plot_cme(savings.logit2, effect = "educ", condition = "age")
d <- plot_cme(savings.logit2, effect = "age", condition = "educ")
grid.arrange(a,b, ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(c,d, ncol = 2)
```
Question A: Start with the plots from the first model (click left thumbnail image to view). What does each plot tell us about the marginal effects of education and age on savings?
Answer:

Question B: Discuss the pair of plots from the second model on the right. What does each plot tell us about how savings vary as a function of age and education?
Answer: 

Q15. The `plot_cap` function allows us to plot the predicted values conditional on different values of the data. Run the code and answer the question below. 

```{r q15, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Do not modify this code
plot_cap(savings.logit2, condition = c("age", "gender"))
```
Question: Describe the patterns observed in the plot. What does this tell us about the probability of having a savings account by age and gender?
